We are about to start a typescript project that will be a RESTful API to interact with a Telegram Bot.
This application will receive request from the Telegram servers and parse it to then be processed by Google Gemini LLM.
This processing can result into function calling that will be parsed again to be then running the appropriate methods.
This bot will be used by our church members. One of the core features is to CRUD the room availabilities.
The code will then return responses over http to the Telegram chatbot.

Stack:
- typescript
- express
- postgresql
- pg
- docker

Start by building the project structure.
Create a dockerfile that will build the project.
Create a docker compose file that will run the project.
Use the .env file with some setup already on it.
Create .gitignore file that will ignore the node_modules folder and other considerable files.

ALWAYS consider the security of the code.
ALWAYS consider the best practices of the code.
ALWAYS consider the performance of the code.
ALWAYS consider the maintainability of the code.

Lets get to it!
